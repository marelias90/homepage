                <div class="experience-narrative">
                    <p>My journey as a product and leadership executive spans over a decade, where I've consistently driven transformative growth across multiple industries. Currently, as the Chief Product Officer at PVcase, I'm leading product strategy for a next-generation PV software-as-a-service company that's raised $123M and employs over 250 people globally. Our work is helping revolutionize the energy transition through innovative software solutions.</p>
                    
                    <p>Prior to PVcase, I served as Vice President of Product at Staffbase from 2021 to 2023, where I orchestrated a remarkable scaling journey. I built and led a world-class product organization that grew to encompass 32+ high-performing teams across 5 distinct business units, serving 2500+ customers worldwide. Under my leadership, our product management team expanded from 30 to more than 85 full-time employees, while company revenue surged from $35M to over $100M ARR.</p>
                    
                    <p>My experience with rapid scaling began at scoutbee, where I joined as the first executive product hire from 2019 to 2021. There, I built an industry-disrupting product management and design team from the ground up. Starting with just 5 team members, I strategically grew our capabilities to 17 full-time employees, enabling us to acquire significant customers and partners including Unilever, Audi, and SAP.</p>
                    
                    <p>Throughout these roles, I've developed a deep understanding of the challenges organizations face during critical growth phases. My approach combines strategic vision with practical execution, helping leadership teams navigate complexity while building sustainable, high-performing organizations. This hands-on experience informs my coaching practice, allowing me to provide valuable insights to executives and teams facing similar growth challenges.</p>
