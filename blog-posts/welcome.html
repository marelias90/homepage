                <p>I'm thrilled to announce that Bryan Chen and Philip Westergaard have joined our executive coaching practice as Associate Coaches. Their addition marks an exciting expansion of our capabilities to serve founders and leadership teams navigating critical growth phases.</p>
                
                <h2>Bryan Chen: Product Leadership Specialist</h2>
                
                <p>Bryan brings over 15 years of product leadership experience across both enterprise and consumer technology companies. Most recently as CPO at Dataflow, he led the product organization through their growth from Series B to successful acquisition, scaling the team from 8 to 45 product managers while maintaining their innovative edge.</p>
                
                <p>Bryan's coaching specialties include:</p>
                
                <p>- Product organization design and scaling<br>
                - Product strategy in competitive markets<br>
                - Cross-functional alignment between product, engineering, and design<br>
                - Building product-led growth engines</p>
                
                <p>His approach combines practical frameworks with deep empathy for the challenges product leaders face when scaling rapidly. Bryan has a particular gift for helping technical founders evolve into strategic product visionaries without losing their connection to the engineering organization.</p>
                
                <h2>Philip Westergaard: Revenue Leadership Expert</h2>
                
                <p>Philip joins us after an impressive career building and scaling revenue organizations at high-growth B2B companies. As CRO at TechStack, he architected the go-to-market strategy that drove their growth from $5M to $75M ARR in just three years, building a reputation for creating sales cultures that balance high performance with sustainable practices.</p>
                
                <p>Philip specializes in coaching leaders through:</p>
                
                <p>- Sales organization design and scaling<br>
                - Go-to-market strategy development<br>
                - Sales and marketing alignment<br>
                - International expansion planning</p>
                
                <p>His coaching philosophy emphasizes the human elements of sales leadership—helping founders and executives build revenue organizations that deliver consistent results while developing the next generation of sales leaders.</p>
                
                <h2>Expanding Our Impact</h2>
                
                <p>With Bryan and Philip joining our practice, we're now able to offer specialized coaching across the full spectrum of challenges facing scaling companies:</p>
                
                <p>- Executive leadership and organizational design<br>
                - Product strategy and management<br>
                - Revenue growth and go-to-market execution</p>
                
                <p>This holistic approach allows us to support leadership teams not just individually but as integrated units working toward common objectives. We've found this comprehensive support particularly valuable for companies navigating the complex transitions from early traction to sustainable growth.</p>
                
                <h2>Our Commitment</h2>
                
                <p>As we expand our coaching team, our commitment remains unchanged: providing leaders with the strategic guidance, practical frameworks, and emotional support needed to navigate the existential challenges of scaling organizations.</p>
                
                <p>We believe that better leadership creates better companies, and better companies create better outcomes for employees, customers, and communities. Bryan and Philip share this vision, and I couldn't be more excited to have them join our mission.</p>
                
                <p>If you're interested in working with Bryan or Philip, or want to learn more about our expanded coaching offerings, please reach out through our contact page.</p>
